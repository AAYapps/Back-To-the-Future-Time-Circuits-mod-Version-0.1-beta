heres my suggestions

1.have the screen fade on timejump and clear all objects,change weather (better would be to reload cars and peds) theres a snow mod so maybe have that enabled when you jump to december? as the snow mod is easily enabled with simple trainer or SNT 
2.add the timecircuits menu in the corner and make it smaller less in the way also a simpler way to input numbers 
3.make the script only function when inside the spacedocker this would allow it to sit in the game until you get in the delorean and it turns on 
4.when turning on rc mode don't change the camera instead let the player or the camera watch the car drive away as in don't have a chasecam or have both selectable with v 
5.hover mode for now just make the car act as a hydra without the folding tires 
6.better particle effects and the 3 explosions when the delorean has arrived 
7.less sound effects and lower volume on the soundeffects 
8.an ini for functions aswell as hotkeys i would personally like to change or disable the spawn delorean turn on mod key as i'd like the mod to automatically turn on inside the delorean 
9.maybe make the thrusters work as a sortof nitro i know the movies never had the thrusters working when driving apart from flying but still have shift activate the thrusters 
10.just for fun make the script work when driving trains so you can timejump in a train. 
11 maybe for later, let the delorean spawn somewhere and when you get in you will get attacked by the libeans (those vw bus's)
